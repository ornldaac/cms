# GitHub Account

An account on [GitHub](https://github.com) is also needed if you want to modify this repository via a pull request, or to access a JupyterHub like [NASA Openscape's 2i2c]().

This [document](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github#signing-up-for-a-new-personal-account) provides information on how to sign up for a free personal GitHub account.

## Git
Once you have a GitHub account, you should also familiarize yourself with basic `git` concepts. This [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git) is helpful to get you started with `git`, especially [this cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

Let's go ahead and clone this [CMS data tutorials](https://github.com/ornldaac/cms) git repository by issuing the following command on the terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ornldaac/cms.git
```
