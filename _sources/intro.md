# NASA Carbon Monitoring System Data Tutorials

## NASA CMS
The Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) is directed through a 2010 Congressional Appropriation and 
is a forward-looking activity designed to develop a prototype carbon monitoring system based on 
scientific research towards characterizing, quantifying, understanding, and predicting the 
evolution of carbon sources and sinks from regional to global scales through improved 
quantification of carbon reservoirs and fluxes. 

The CMS program funds basic and applied research that is created while engaging with a user 
community in a way that bridges carbon science and user communities to better serve societal needs.
By connecting carbon cycle science research to stakeholders who use the data in their 
decision making, NASA CMS contributes to understanding and meeting the needs of the climate 
data user community.

There have been three phases of the CMS projects: CMS Phase I (2010-2012), CMS Phase II (2011-2016), and
CMS Phase III (2018-2023). Learn more about NASA CMS program at https://carbon.nasa.gov/, and 
in the following reports {cite}`Hurtt2014,Hurtt2014b,Hurtt2022`:

## CMS Datasets

As of today, there are [182 CMS data products](https://carbon.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/available_archived_products.pl) 
that are archived at different NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). In addition, there are 
[106 data products](https://carbon.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/available_archived_products.pl#avail) that are yet to be
archived at a NASA DAAC.

## Data Tutorials
These data tutorials will introduce how to search and discover CMS datasets and access and visualize the datasets using various
data services and tools. The tutorials will also demonstrate how to integrate the CMS datasets with other 
NASA datasets such as GEDI and ICESat-2 lidar datasets.
